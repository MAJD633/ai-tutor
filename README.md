# Smart Tutor AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Smart Tutor AI is an AI-powered virtual assistant that helps students learn better by giving them personalized study plans, feedback, and explanations using natural language. It adapts to different levels and subjects.

## Background

Many students struggle with finding the right way to study or donâ€™t get enough feedback and support when learning on their own. This is especially common in areas with limited access to high-quality education.

I was personally motivated by seeing how students in remote or rural areas face challenges in getting proper tutoring. This project aims to make education more personalized and accessible using AI.

Problems it addresses:
* Lack of personalized learning
* Limited access to expert tutors
* Learning gaps due to one-size-fits-all teaching

## How is it used?

Smart Tutor AI is used through a web or mobile application. A student logs in, answers a few questions about their learning level and goals, and the AI creates a daily plan.

Users can:
* Ask questions in natural language
* Get instant feedback on assignments
* Receive customized quizzes and revision plans

This is especially useful for:
- Students preparing for exams
- Adults doing self-learning
- Teachers needing support in classrooms

## Data sources and AI methods

- Data: Past exam papers, textbooks, online open-source course materials (e.g. Khan Academy, MIT OCW)
- Methods:
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Reinforcement Learning (for personalized recommendations)
  - Chatbot frameworks like Rasa or OpenAI API

Example API: [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs)

## Challenges

- Does not replace human teachers.
- Ethical risks of over-reliance on AI.
- Needs constant updating to ensure accuracy.
- Requires internet access and a device.
- Risk of bias in training data if not carefully curated.

## What next?

The next step would be:
- Building a working chatbot prototype.
- Testing with a small group of students.
- Gathering feedback and improving the learning engine.

Support needed:
- Collaborators with teaching experience
- Access to open educational datasets
- Funding for development and testing
